## Project instructions


Please write your code in Python3. You are allowed to use Google when completing this test. Please do not share the test and complete the test on your own. The interview coding question will be significant harder than this test.


## Problem


There is a list of *randomly sorted* continuous integers such as:


l = [6, 5,4, 6, 2]


One of the elements is missing. In the example above, it is 3


One of the elements is duplicate. In the example above, it is 6.


Your job is to write as many functions as possible ranging from O(n^2) to O(n) that returns the tuple (missing, duplicate).


For example, your function is called foo


then, the function should pass the following assert


`assert(foo([6, 5,4, 6, 2]) = (3, 6)`


For each function you write, please leave comment on what's the time and space complexities as well as pros and cons of each function.


## How to submit


Once having completed the test please push to a new repo on Github and send the the repo URL to hamid@softmaxdata.com
